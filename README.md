# Text Mining - Zachary Sherman
First, populate `config.py.template` with the relevant API details, obtainable using a Twitter Developer account, according to the instructions found [here](https://sd2020spring.github.io/assignments/mini-project-3-text-mining.html#data-source-twitter). Rename the file to `config.py`.  

The main script can then be run using `python text_mining.py`.  

The user will be asked to input a username. The tweets posted by this username are then retrieved and analyzed by the script.

My write-up and reflection are available [here](https://github.com/sd2020spring/TextMining-Zachary3352/raw/master/MP3%20Write%20Up%20and%20Reflection.pdf).
