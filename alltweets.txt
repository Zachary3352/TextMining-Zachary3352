b'@Barnacules Hmm... isn\'t it "Day = Made" not ==?'
b"@jonotan86 IMO no, because you can't control them from a wall switch. Less expensive to just buy smart switches on Amazon like these: https://t.co/AgRg1jWT8g I have them and they're pretty good, but sometimes you have to tap them twice bc the buttons aren't great."
b'@reneritchie Gif statement'
b'@DctrGizmo Yes!! Totally agree. I usually want to know if they fixed the bug I found, and of course the release notes never say.'
b'@garywhitta Welcome back to molaburatura where safety ees number one prorority!'
b'@FrankMoreiraV @SnazzyQ I know, but it\'s still misleading and frustrating. If they had a warning, even, that would help. Something like, "demands are increased due to black Friday. Please note, this may incur delays".'
b'@SnazzyQ I had the same issue today. Called Amazon, and they said from their end there was no delay. I chalked it up to snow in my area, but it sounds like it\'s just Black Friday delays. 2-day Prime shipping is more of a "when we feel like it" than a guarantee.'
b'@mattdgonzalez Yeah, I\'ve complained to Amazon a lot lately by phone about the word "guaranteed" not actually meaning guaranteed. I\'ve read them the definition, told them that sending adapters late when I need them for 300+ person presentations is not cool, etc, but it does nothing.'
b"Hey @Twitter @TwitterSupport allowing advertisers like this is pretty not cool. If it was a mistake, no problem, but they should be de-promoted. I'm all for free speech, but essay-writing services are probably illegal and go against academic integrity. https://t.co/04GHedPlzO"
b"@hoodoer @deviantollam Ugh it's really hard to explain to friends why I have a CH751 key on my keychain.\n\nUsually goes like this: Well, it's *supposed* to open everything, but it's only actually opened like two things."
b'@lalexgreen I can corroborate, Alex does this! Putting your frustrations "out there" does at least two [IMO great] things: 1. Makes you realize your problems might not be as bad as you think they are. 2. Lets you get them out of your mind, at LEAST for the class period.'
b"@ashertech Some garnish would look good, and if you take the photo from the side with a fast aperture, it'll look nice. Focus on the garnish (some parsley leaves) so the photo is sharp. Last, add some interesting lighting! Tweet the photo you take!"

b'@joeyfameli FOMO?'
b"@jonotan86 Tilde, except when I'm editing video. Page Up/Down. Home/End. Scroll lock. Break. To name a few! I should probably figure out how to make macros with these keys."
b"@smartereveryday Just started learning Matlab at engineering school. Not too hard to get into, but it seems difficult to do complex things until you really know what you're doing."
b'@OlinCollege Working on the hexapod?'
b"@deitymicrophone Oh yeah, I forgot about your system specifically. It does seem pretty strong. However, I don't think professional theater will switch over to fully 2.4ghz any time soon..."
b"@deitymicrophone Or a different UHF frequency band... 2.4Ghz systems compete with WiFi. In a small theater, it's fine, but with big productions, you never know."
b"@chillmage Yeah, it's super messed up. Really not cool. As a college freshman (albeit a very responsible one who tells my family often about what's going on at school), that is just way too much control and abuse. TI needs to let his daughter grow up."
b"@Gwanatu @AraWagco @journeydan True! I'm keeping it until Google makes a significantly better watch, which may be never."
b'@Gwanatu @AraWagco @journeydan Me too!'

b'@ashertech Ah, makes sense.'
b"@ashertech Or you could even build a smart clock! I'm working on one now, but it's much more work than setting up octoprint. https://t.co/tPjXzyk1bV"
b'@ashertech Got it. Octoprint for a 3D printer?'
b'@ashertech You could just do a borderless build if you get a mirror slightly larger than the display you use. Then just like glue the display to the back of the mirror and put it on a stand like a picture.'
b'@ashertech Build a smart mirror! https://t.co/mCZzxmU9hR Or put a VPN at your house with OpenVPN.'
b'@ashertech Oh shoot I completely forgot about that. Glad you figured it out!'
b'@ashertech Yep, sounds like it. Lmk if you need more help, and good luck with a full format!'
b"@ashertech Ah, I see. I believe I've had issues with SD cards in Pis before. SanDisk? If so, check and make sure it's not showing up as 30.6mb. If it is, it's toast and even SD card formatter can't get it back, unfortunately."
b'@ashertech Sounds good. Raspbian direct install may work better depending on the pi and this install. Which pi are you using? Is it new out of the box with the original psu?'
b"@ashertech Sounds good. What os are you running? If it's not raspbian, it could be ssh only (octoprint for example). Lmk how formatting the card works out!"
b'@CharlesRiverMus Cool!'
b'@ashertech In general? Like before setup? Should be less than a minute if I remember correctly. You should see stuff on the screen after only a couple seconds.'
b"@OlinCollege Hopper day!! Let's go!"
b'@deviantollam @Moonman0922 Oof, so true. I once got locked out of an office building after a long night and just needed to grab some gear I had left inside. There was basically no other option besides making the boss drive 20 minutes to unlock the building for me, but an old credit card did the trick!'

b"@theMrMobile Well, mixed feelings: First, wow!! This is so cool. But also, you're moving out of Boston, and I've always found it cool that a youtuber I really like lives here, so... at least @pointjules still does!"
b'@EndlessJeopardy What is a pop filterabc?'
b'@mopeymercury5 @iKevinWebb @SuperSaf Yeah its SUPER saturated now...'
b'@Barnacules @MrsBarnacules Great to hear! Good luck at the doctor.'
b"@SnazzyQ @WorId_Languages Honestly, they kind of sound like phone mics to me... maybe that's because they haven't been equalized? Or maybe Twitter compression... but I can definitely notice a difference. B is brighter."
b'@TwitterDesign Why stop at one hour?'
b'@MegavoltService @mattfield @RachelTobac True. Protip: Buy them on eBay listed as "Sweat Protectors." They\'ll be unlubed and much cheaper than condoms. Also, you don\'t have to worry about individual packaging and squeamish actors.'
b"@KimMoldofsky @RachelTobac Yep, this. Esp awkward when you're a high school sound tech mic'ing up your female friends, or worse, adult females."
b"@MegavoltService @mattfield @RachelTobac Condoms work great as sweat protectors for mics... Don't tell actors what you're using, though, or they'll laugh about it until the end of the production."
b"@RachelTobac I can't help but think about EVEN more expensive, proprietary mic elements that turn off the packs when broken. So while I love the idea of smaller packs, I think another solution for batteries is needed. But I completely understand your pov and we definitely need better packs."
b"@RachelTobac I have a mixed response to this... On the one hand, I've had actors put mic packs on their bras, in specially-made pockets in costumes, and other weird places, but on the other hand, when I think of batteries embedded in a mic element (cable and mic itself), (1/2)"
b"@deviantollam @RachelTobac @tarah As a sound engineer for over 20 plays/musicals/TEDx, I know that what you and @tarah do is SO helpful. I love this tweet for the same reason I love @donttrythis's glasses microphone -- you already know what you need and come prepared and ready to help the engineer. Awesome!"
b'Hmm... I feel like this kind of goes against the idea of Twitter. What do you think? https://t.co/m6Jf4pXoot'
b"@CoolChopy Yeah, me too. I can't watch a movie without analyzing it from a technical perspective. Completely the same thing with a theater show. In a way, it's messed up my experience of shows/movies, buuut I also like to see things from this perspective."

b"@makersmuse I have one and I really like it. It doesn't do 4k60, but it sounds like that won't be an issue for you. Stabilization is incredible (OIS and IBIS together) and it has a flip-out screen, among other nice features. Definitely worth considering!"
b"@makersmuse The G85 (G7's successor) is a fantastic camera, esp for the price. GH5S is even better, but you'll pay for the quality. BMPCC4K only makes sense if you want to spend a lot of time focusing, coloring, and storing footage. My rec: G85 or GH5S if you have the budget. Both great!"
b'@morgancooperdp I just watched "U Shoot Videos?" for the first time and was blown away. Everything from the story (much of which I can relate to, some of which I can\'t) to the cinematography, to the color was absolutely incredible. Thx for giving me the privilege of watching it.'
